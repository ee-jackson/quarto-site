I'm a research scientist with interests in plant community ecology and forest ecosystems. I hold a PhD in quantitative modelling in Ecology and Evolution from the University of Reading. Mostly, I use computational methods and large data to study the natural world.

Currently, I am a [Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Oxford.](https://www.biology.ox.ac.uk/people/eleanor-jackson)
