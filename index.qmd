Hello! I'm a research scientist currently working on the restoration of logged tropical forests [at the University of Oxford](https://www.biology.ox.ac.uk/people/eleanor-jackson).

I hold a PhD from the _Quantitative Modelling in Ecology and Evolution_ NERC CDT at the University of Reading, which focused on pre-dispersal Janzen-Connell effects and was supervised by [Sofia Gripenberg](https://www.reading.ac.uk/ecology/staff/sofia-gripenberg). Prior to my PhD, I received a BSc in _Zoology_ from the University of Exeter and a MRes in _Biodiversity, Evolution and Conservation_ from University College London.

Broadly, my interests lie in quantitative and community ecology -- utilising maths and statistics to understand how species coexist. I'm particularly excited by:

- Tropical forests
- Interactions between plants & their natural enemies
- Species coexistence and conspecific density-dependence
- Complex ecological data and Bayesian modelling
- Open & reproducible science
