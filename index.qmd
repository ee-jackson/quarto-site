I'm a research scientist with interests in community ecology, forest ecology and plant-insect interactions. I hold a PhD in quantitative modelling in Ecology and Evolution from the University of Reading. Mostly, I use quantitative methods to study the natural world. I work with the programming language [{{< fa brands r-project >}}](https://www.r-project.org) and I'm enthusiastic about reproducible research. 

Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Reading.
