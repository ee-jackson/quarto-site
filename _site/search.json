    "text": "seed natural enemies and forest plant diversity\n High local species richness in tropical forests poses a challenge to general ecological theory, where competition for resources limits local alpha diversity through competitive exclusion. The Janzen-Connell hypothesis proposes that coexistence is achieved through the role of specialist plant enemies, which reduce recruitment close to reproductive adults of the same species and in areas of high conspecific density.\nThe role of natural enemies in structuring and maintaining plant diversity in tropical forests is being increasingly recognised. To date, research has focused almost exclusively on enemies attacking seeds after dispersal from the parent plant. However, we don’t know much about the fate of seeds that are still developing and attached to the parent plant. Pre-dispersal seed predation could cause a reduction in the number of seeds that are successfully dispersed, with unknown consequences for plant diversity maintenance.\nMy doctoral research with Dr Sofia Gripenberg aims to investigate the role of pre-dispersal seed enemies in plant diversity maintenance. With Barro Colorado Island in Panama as a field site, I am using long-term seed rain data to model community dynamics and collecting information on individual plant species and their enemies in the field."

Multiple studies have identified huge variability in herbivory across different levels of biological organisation. A small fraction of plants can experience disproportionately high levels of herbivore damage, whilst the majority experience relatively low levels. Despite the potential ecological and evolutionary consequences of such variability, we still cannot explain why these patterns emerge so frequently in nature.\nI am a member of the Herbivory Variability Network, a global collaboration of researchers which aims to describe and understand how and why patterns in plant–herbivore interactions vary across the tree of life and around the world."

    "text": "The McMurdo Ice Shelf. Photo: Anne Jungblut\n\n\nThe second of my 16-week research projects undertaken as a part of my MRes was based at the Natural History Museum (NHM), London. I was working with samples of microbial mat communities from meltwater ponds in Antartica, arguably one of the weirdest habitats on earth.\nThe McMurdo Ice Shelf in Antartica forms a 50m thick undulating surface of ice floating on the sea. Annual summer thawing of ice and snow causes the formation of thousands of ponds in depressions on the ice. Variable amounts of trapped marine sediments and salt are released from the ice as it melts. This results in ponds which are very close together in space and yet at opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of salinity and pH. They can vary in size from thousands of meters in diameter to two, and have assorted levels of ice cover.\nThe meltwater ponds of the McMurdo Ice Shelf are colonised by microbial mats, one of the few things that can survive in these extreme environments. Microbial mats are one of the earliest signs of life found on earth, thought to have been present 4,000 million years ago. They owe their persistence to their co-operative nature. The mats are actually composed of lots of different kinds of micro-organisms, organised into a multi-layered, three dimensional sheet. Each layer contains organisms with a different functional role. There are oxygen- and sun- loving cyanobacteria in the upper layers gradually giving way to anaerobic and sulphate- loving bacteria at the lowest levels, with many other groups in-between. The cyanobacteria at the top convert sunlight into energy and the waste products of the organisms at each layer are then food for the layer below them.\n\n\n\nCollection of microbial mat samples\n\n\nIn this study, we wanted to understand how the extreme environments of the meltwater ponds might shape the microbial mat communities residing in them.\nMy supervisor, Anne Jungblut and her collaborator, Ian Hawes, had spent a field season in Antartica and returned with six frozen microbial mat samples from six meltwater ponds and measurements of pH, conductivity (a measure of salinity) and temperature from each.\nTo find out what was living in the mats we had to extract DNA from each sample and amplify it (via PCR) ready for sequencing. This involved lots of shiny high-tech equipment and many failed attempts.\n\nWeeks of hard work were condensed down into 550 nano grams of PCR product in very tiny test tubes and sent to the NHM sequencing facility. After a nail biting wait, we were rewarded with reams of DNA sequence data. Matching our data to a database of known DNA sequences for different organisms, we were able to determine the community composition of each of our microbial mat samples.\nThis was the first time eukaryote communities from these habitats had been analysed, and we collected more samples than had been used in previous studies, enabling us to look at heterogeneity within each pond for the first time.\nWe found that communities from different ponds were all quite different from each other. Mats from the saltiest pond and the most acidic pond were especially different from the others. We also saw that these two ponds, which were at the extremes, had lower species diversity and richness. Different communities taken from the same pond were very similar. Taken together, these results could be suggestive of environmental filtering.\nEnvironmental filtering happens when species arrive at a location but are unable to persist there due to aboitic conditions. So, while some species are able to exist in ponds just few meters away, the extreme salinity of a neighbouring pond may prohibit them from establishing there.\nThe findings from this study will further our understanding of processes that sustain biodiversity in ice-based habitats, which is especially important with the acceleration of environmental change that may accompany future, and current, polar warming. Understanding biodiversity in extreme environments can also provide us with a window into the past. Some of the oldest recognisable Precambrian fossils are of laminated cyanobacterial mats. The communities we have characterised here, may not be so different to those that existed in the early days of life on Earth.\nRead the paper here\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en_gb"

    "title": "Why do trees abort their offspring, and what are the effects on biodiversity?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Immature and mature fruits of Oenocarpus mapora. Photos: STRI\n\n\nWalking around a tropical forest it is not uncommon to come across unripe fruits on the forest floor. Trees will often abort the development of their offspring if deemed unlikely to survive, allowing them to fall and die. This may seem wasteful, however, growing fruits to maturation is energetically expensive for the plant. With limited resources, it may be more beneficial for a plant to cut its losses and abort some of its fruits.\nPlants may prematurely abort their fruits if the offspring becomes damaged. Fruits contain energy-rich sugars and nutrients to attract dispersal agents, however, many groups of animals have become predatory. They differ from seed dispersers, as rather than digesting the fruit and leaving the seed unharmed, a seed predator will eat the seed, killing it in the process. The seed itself is an individual organism (or soon to be one), hence the term ‘predator’ rather than ‘herbivore’.\nOne of the more widespread groups of seed predators in tropical forests are internally-feeding insects, which lay their eggs on fruits and spend their larval phase feeding on the plant’s seeds. The vast majority are highly host-specific, with each species of insect predating upon a single plant species.\n\n\n\nFruits dropped prematurely are unlikely to germinate. Created with BioRender\n\n\nIf seed predators (or other enemies of seeds, e.g. pathogens) are causing trees to drop their fruits before they are fully developed, they could also contribute to maintaining tropical plant diversity. Seed enemies are more abundant in areas where there are many of their host seeds. Therefore, in areas of the forest where many trees of the same species grow close to each other, the tree’s offspring may be more likely to come under attack and die. This mechanism (known negative density-dependence) works to prevent a single tree species from dominating the forest, encouraging the tremendous number of tree species found in tropical forests.\nFor the first project of my PhD, I wanted to find out if seed enemies could be causing trees to drop their fruits prematurely. To do this, we took advantage of a huge data collection effort co-ordinated by Joe Wright which has been on-going on Barro Colorado Island, Panama for over 30 years. Two hundred seed rain traps have been set up on the island – a simple construction of PVC pipes and netting – which collect any fruits or seeds which fall from the canopy. Our collaborator Osvaldo Calderón checks the traps once a week and is able to identify the tree species from which the fruit fell and whether the fruit is fully ripe or whether it has been dropped prematurely.\n\n\n\nSeed rain traps on Barro Colorado Island. Photos: STRI\n\n\nWe found that across all 201 species in the data set, a large proportion of seeds were dropped before completing their development, almost 40%! This percentage was much higher for some tree species than others. Was there something about those tree species which made them more likely to drop their fruits prematurely? We predicted that species with properties that are likely to make them more to be vulnerable to attack would drop more of their fruit prematurely. For example, tree species which have larger seeds provide more food and therefore might be a bigger target for seed predators. We could then test if our predictions held up. From previous work, we also knew which tree species are attacked by those internally-feeding insects which I mentioned before.\n\n\n\nAverage rates of premature seed abscission across 31 years\n\n\nThe results of our analysis found that 4 out of 6 of our predictions were supported and that tree species known to be attacked by internally-feeding insects had higher levels of premature fruit drop. These results are in support of the theory that seed predators could be causing some premature fruit drop. Combined with our finding that nearly 40% of seeds are dropped prematurely, this suggests that seed predators feeding on seeds in the canopy could have an important role in deciding which trees grow where.\nThe fate of trees in their earliest life stages, when they are still developing and attached to their mother tree, has on the whole been overlooked in tropical forests. Yet with so many individuals lost at this early stage, our study suggests that we should pay closer attention to the goings on up in the canopy if we want to understand how forests work.\nRead the paper here\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en_gb"

    "title": "Searching for spring: how to get data from the iNaturalist API in R",
    "section": "",
    "text": "iNaturalist is an online community where people can record and share observations. We have been using iNaturalist in our group for student projects. It’s proved a great way to teach how to collect and analyse data while the lab and field have been off-limits. To find a way to make data collection easier, I have been playing around with iNaturalist’s API.\nIt has been a long, dark winter for those of us under lockdown in the UK and to give myself something to look forward to, I decided to look into when we might expect to see the first Spring bulbs emerging.\niNaturalist does have a bulk download facility, but you can’t pull the data directly into R, and I want to filter the data by term_id, which is not an option when using the export facility.\n\n\n\nI’m going to use functions from {httr} to query the API, and {jsonlite} to deal with the ugly json file that the API will return 🙅\n\nlibrary(\"tidyverse\")\nlibrary(\"httr\")\nlibrary(\"jsonlite\")\n\nThe API will only give us 200 records at a time, this is the max number of records per page, so I’m writing a function that I can use to repeatedly hit the server. The call I’m using includes filters to pull out the data I want to look at. Briefly, I’m filtering for observations of plants iconic_taxa=Plantae, in the UK place_id=6857, which have the annotations Plant Phenology term_id=12, and Flowering term_value_id=13. Annotations are a little different to Observation Fields in iNaturalist. Observation Fields can be created and added by anyone, whereas Annotations are maintained by iNaturalist administrators. This means I will probably pull fewer observations, but they might be more reliable.\nUsually you’d use the page parameter to cycle through each page and retrieve all the results, however, if there are more than 10k results, iNaturalist recommends you sort by ascending ID order_by=id&order=asc, and use the id_above parameter set to the ID of the record in the last batch.\n\nget_obs &lt;- function(max_id){\n\n    # an API call that has \"id_above =\" at the end\n    call &lt;- paste(\"https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/observations?\n                  iconic_taxa=Plantae&term_id=12&term_value_id=13&place_id=6857\n                  &d1=2017-01-01&per_page=200&order_by=id&order=asc&id_above=\", \n                  max_id, sep=\"\")\n     \n    # making the API call, parsing it to JSON and then flatten\n    GET(url = call) %&gt;%\n    content(as = \"text\", encoding = \"UTF-8\") %&gt;%\n    fromJSON(flatten = TRUE) -&gt; get_call_json\n     \n    # this grabs just the data we want and makes it a data frame\n    as.data.frame(get_call_json$results)\n    \n}\n\nNow that we have our function, I’m going to use it to pull the first page of results by setting max_id to zero. Once we’ve got that, we can create a list with our first page of results as the first item. I can then use a while loop to continually hit the API and append each new page to the list. The loop will run while the number of rows in a page is equal to 200. The last page of results will have less than 200 rows, and the loop will stop running. I’ve also told it to print the page number so I can see how it’s progressing, although I won’t print all that output in this post.\n\n# get the first page\nobs &lt;- get_obs(max_id = 0)\nmax_id &lt;- max(obs[[\"id\"]])\nthisisalist &lt;- list(page_1 = obs)\npage &lt;- 1\n\nwhile (nrow(obs) == 200) {\n    Sys.sleep(0.5)\n    page &lt;- page + 1\n    page_count &lt;- paste(\"page\", page, sep = \"_\")\n    obs &lt;- get_obs(max_id = max_id)\n    thisisalist[[page_count]] &lt;- obs\n    max_id &lt;- max(obs[[\"id\"]])\n    print(page_count)\n    print(max_id)\n}\n\n\n\n\nWe can now bind all the elements of the list into one big dataframe and explore.\n\nthisisnotalist &lt;- bind_rows(thisisalist)\ndim(thisisnotalist)\n\n[1] 21836   160\n\n\nThere are a lot of different variables! I’m interested in observed_on. Let’s convert it to date format and do some quick overview plots.\n\nthisisnotalist %&gt;%\n    mutate(observed_on_date = as.Date(observed_on, \"%Y-%m-%d\"),\n     day_of_year = as.numeric(strftime(observed_on_date, \n     format = \"%j\")) ) -&gt; flower_obs\n\nflower_obs %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = observed_on_date)) +\n    geom_bar(color = \"#264653\") +\n    scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"1 year\", date_labels = \"%Y\") +\n    labs(x = \"Day observed\")\n\n\n\n\nThe number of observations recorded has increased each year, probably due to iNaturalist gaining popularity. There are also many more observations in the summer months than in the winter. We can get a better look at this pattern plotting by month.\n\nflower_obs %&gt;%\n  filter(observed_on_details.year &lt; 2021) %&gt;% # we don't have the full data for this yr\n    ggplot(aes(x= as.factor(observed_on_details.month))) +\n    geom_bar(fill = \"grey90\", color = \"#264653\") +\n    labs(x= \"Month observed\")\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a peak in April with observations slowly dropping throughout the year. I didn’t quite expect that. I would have assumed that observations of flowering plants would be relatively flat from April to August as different plants come into flower at different points throughout the spring and summer. Perhaps this is due to some kind of sampling bias in how people are recording observations. Let’s have a look at which plants are the first to flower.\n\nflower_obs %&gt;%\n    group_by(taxon.name, taxon.preferred_common_name) %&gt;%\n    summarise(median_day = median(day_of_year), n_obs = n()) %&gt;%\n    ungroup() %&gt;%\n    # filter to sp with more than 20 observations \n    # to make sure we get a representitive sample size\n    filter(n_obs &gt; 20) %&gt;% \n    slice_min(order_by = median_day, n = 15) %&gt;%\n    knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntaxon.name\ntaxon.preferred_common_name\nmedian_day\nn_obs\n\n\n\n\nPetasites fragrans\nWinter Heliotrope\n29.0\n25\n\n\nCorylus avellana\ncommon hazel\n43.0\n37\n\n\nCrocus tommasinianus\nWoodland crocus\n48.0\n22\n\n\nGalanthus nivalis\ncommon snowdrop\n50.0\n208\n\n\nCyclamen coum\nEastern Sowbread\n55.0\n31\n\n\nViburnum tinus\nLaurustinus viburnum\n58.0\n23\n\n\nPrunus cerasifera\nCherry-plum\n65.5\n48\n\n\nNarcissus pseudonarcissus\nwild daffodil\n68.0\n30\n\n\nViola odorata\nSweet violet\n71.0\n64\n\n\nDraba verna\nCommon Whitlowgrass\n72.0\n27\n\n\nMercurialis perennis\nDog’s Mercury\n77.0\n39\n\n\nCardamine hirsuta\nhairy bittercress\n77.5\n40\n\n\nNarcissus\ndaffodils\n79.5\n56\n\n\nPrimula vulgaris\nPrimrose\n82.0\n185\n\n\nTussilago farfara\ncolt’s-foot\n82.0\n91\n\n\n\n\n\nI always think of Crocus coming up first, along with Snowdrops, so it’s reassuring to see them high up on this list. I think it would be nice to get a visualisation of the emergence of different flowers with the changing seasons. I’m going to choose a few which I know emerge fairly sequentially: Snowdrops (genus = Galanthus), Crocus, Daffodils (Narcissus), Hyacinths (Hyacinthoides), Iris, and finally Cyclamen, which flowers through the winter.\nI have to do some fiddling around here with dates to get the x axis labels how I want them. I’m going to change the year for every observation to be 2020, so that data from different years can be grouped together. I also use floor_date from {lubridate} to round dates to the week they were observed. e.g. Tuesday 6th and Thursday 8th would both be rounded down to Sunday 4th. This allows me to plot by week and label by month.\n\nlibrary(\"lubridate\")\n\nflower_obs %&gt;%\n  filter(str_detect(taxon.name, \"Narcissus\") | \n           str_detect(taxon.name, \"Iris\") | \n           str_detect(taxon.name, \"Crocus\")| \n           str_detect(taxon.name, \"Galanthus\")|\n           str_detect(taxon.name, \"Hyacinthoides\")|\n           str_detect(taxon.name, \"Cyclamen\")) %&gt;% \n  separate(taxon.name, into = c(\"genus\", \"sp\"), sep = \" \") %&gt;%\n  mutate(date = as.Date(paste(2020, strftime(observed_on, format = \"%m-%d\"), \n                              sep=\"-\")) ) %&gt;% \n  mutate(week = floor_date(date, \"week\")) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x= week, fill = genus)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"1 month\",  expand = c(0,0),\n               date_labels = \"%B\", limits = as.Date(c(\"2020-01-01\", \"2020-12-31\"))) +\n  coord_polar() + \n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\"#264653\", \"#2A9D8F\", \"#8AB17D\",\n               \"#E9C46A\", \"#F4A261\", \"#E76F51\")) +\n  theme_void(base_size = 9)\n\n\n\n\nI feel like this is a really nice one to use coord_polar() for. You can see how the months blend into each other, without a break at Dec/Jan. Narcissus flowering phenology is well represented here, you can see how it steadily increases to a peak and then dips down again.\nBut ok, what about if you live in Edinburgh, are you going to see Daffs on the same day as people in London? Maybe we can see how geography affects flowering observations.\nWe want {sf} to work with spatial features, {rnaturalearthdata} to get a map of the UK, {rnaturalearth} for functions to work with that data and, for fun, {gganimate}.\n\nlibrary(\"sf\")\nlibrary(\"rnaturalearth\")\nlibrary(\"rnaturalearthdata\")\nlibrary(\"gganimate\")\n\n# get a map of the UK as a 'sf' polygon from the natural earth data\nuk_map &lt;- ne_countries(country = \"united kingdom\", scale = 'medium', returnclass = \"sf\")\n\n# filter our data for daffodil observations\n# and extract lattitude and longitude from the 'location' variable\nflower_obs %&gt;%\n    filter(str_detect(taxon.name, \"Narcissus\") & mappable == TRUE ) %&gt;%\n    separate(location, into = c(\"lat\", \"long\"), sep = \",\") %&gt;%\n    select(\"lat\", \"long\", \"day_of_year\") %&gt;%\n    st_as_sf(coords = c( \"long\",\"lat\"), \n        crs = 4326, agr = \"constant\")  -&gt; geo_daff\n\nggplot() +\n    geom_sf(data = uk_map, fill = \"white\") +\n    geom_sf(data = geo_daff, shape = 16, size = 1.5, \n        colour = \"#8AB17D\") +\n    transition_states(as.factor(day_of_year),\n                    state_length = 3) + \n    shadow_mark(past = TRUE, future = FALSE) +\n    ggtitle(\"Daffodils in flower\\n\n        Day of the year: {closest_state}\")\n\n\n\n\nI was hoping we’d see some kind of wave with flowers appearing in the South first, but alas, maybe there’s just not enough data.

I serve on the media committee for the Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary biology (SORTEE).\n\n\npreviously\nI was a Publishing Assistant at Springer Nature and prior to that I was a Research Associate at the University of Hamburg. I completed a BSc in Zoology at the University of Exeter and became a Master of Research (MRes) in Biodiversity, Evolution & Conservation at University College London.\nMy previous research has seen me experimentally evolving phytoplankton in mesocosms, culturing bacteria from amphibian microbiomes and sequencing DNA from meltwater ponds in Antarctica."
